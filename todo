Static Project Listing

Display a list of predefined projects in the sidebar. This will later evolve into a dynamic list that users can add to or modify.

Project Selection Handling
Implement functionality so that when a user clicks on a project name in the sidebar, the main content area updates to show that project's details. Initially, this can simply display the project name or a placeholder message like "Project details displayed here"

Task Addition Mechanism
Add a button or form input in the project details area to allow users to type in a task name and submit it. For Day 1, this can result in console logging the input task name or displaying it as a list item within the project details area.

Real-time Clock or Timer
Utilize setInterval to implement a continuously updating clock or timer displayed prominently in the application, such as in the header or sidebar. This feature is intended to familiarize you with using time-based events.

Basic Event Listeners for Interactivity
Ensure that clicking on project names in the sidebar triggers the content update in the main area.
Make the task addition mechanism (button click or form submission) interactive, capturing user input and displaying it in the console or UI.
